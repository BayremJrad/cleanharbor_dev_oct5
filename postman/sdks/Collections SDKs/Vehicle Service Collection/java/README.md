# VehicleServiceCollectionSdk Java SDK 1.0.0

Welcome to the VehicleServiceCollectionSdk SDK documentation. This guide will help you get started with integrating and using the VehicleServiceCollectionSdk SDK in your project.

## Versions

- SDK version: `1.0.0`

## About the API

# Vehicle Service Collection

The **Vehicle Service API** provides a RESTful interface for managing a registry of vehicles. Use this collection to create, retrieve, update, and delete vehicle records.

## Base URL

All requests use the `{{baseUrl}}` environment variable. The active environment points this to the mock server:

```
https://e6bee6c3-e027-478c-986d-8b4b12923c25.mock.pstmn.io
```

Select the **Mock Environment** in Postman before sending any requests.

## Authentication

No authentication is required for any request in this collection. All endpoints are open and can be called directly once the `{{baseUrl}}` variable is set.

## Requests

| Method   | Endpoint        | Description                                      |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `POST`   | `/vehicles`     | Create a new vehicle record                      |
| `GET`    | `/vehicles/:id` | Retrieve a single vehicle by ID                  |
| `PATCH`  | `/vehicles/:id` | Update fields on an existing vehicle             |
| `DELETE` | `/vehicles/:id` | Remove a vehicle record                          |
| `GET`    | `/vehicles`     | List all vehicles, with optional brand filtering |

# Setup & Configuration

## Supported Language Versions

This SDK is compatible with the following versions: `Java >= 1.8`

## Installation

If you use Maven, place the following within the _dependency_ tag in your `pom.xml` file:

```XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>com</groupId>
    <artifactId>vehicleservicecollectionsdk</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

If you use Gradle, paste the next line inside the _dependencies_ block of your `build.gradle` file:

```Gradle
implementation("com:vehicleservicecollectionsdk:1.0.0")
```

If you use JAR files, package the SDK by running the following command:

```shell
mvn compile assembly:single
```

Then, add the JAR file to your project's classpath.

## Authentication

### API Key Authentication

The VehicleServiceCollectionSdk API uses API keys as a form of authentication. An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate a user, developer, or a program that is calling the API.

#### Setting the API key

When you initialize the SDK, you can set the API key as follows:

```java
import com.vehicleservicecollectionsdk.VehicleServiceCollectionSdk;
import com.vehicleservicecollectionsdk.config.ApiKeyAuthConfig;
import com.vehicleservicecollectionsdk.config.VehicleServiceCollectionSdkConfig;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiKeyAuthConfig apiKeyAuthConfig = ApiKeyAuthConfig.builder()
      .apiKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
      .apiKeyHeader("YOUR_API_KEY_HEADER")
      .build();

    VehicleServiceCollectionSdkConfig config = VehicleServiceCollectionSdkConfig.builder()
      .apiKeyAuthConfig(apiKeyAuthConfig)
      .build();

    VehicleServiceCollectionSdk vehicleServiceCollectionSdk = new VehicleServiceCollectionSdk(
      config
    );
  }
}

```

If you need to set or update the API key after initializing the SDK, you can use:

```java
vehicleServiceCollectionSdk.setApiKey('YOUR_API_KEY');
vehicleServiceCollectionSdk.setApiKeyHeader('YOUR_API_KEY_HEADER');
```

## Setting a Custom Timeout

You can set a custom timeout for the SDK's HTTP requests as follows:

```java
import com.vehicleservicecollectionsdk.VehicleServiceCollectionSdk;
import com.vehicleservicecollectionsdk.config.VehicleServiceCollectionSdkConfig;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    VehicleServiceCollectionSdkConfig config = VehicleServiceCollectionSdkConfig.builder()
      .timeout(10000)
      .build();
    VehicleServiceCollectionSdk vehicleServiceCollectionSdk = new VehicleServiceCollectionSdk(
      config
    );
  }
}

```

## Injecting a Custom HTTP Client

You can supply your own `OkHttpClient` — for example to configure a proxy, a shared connection pool, custom TLS, timeouts, or your own interceptors. The SDK derives its client from the one you provide (preserving your transport settings and interceptors) and layers its own interceptors (such as authentication and retry) on top, so the SDK keeps working as usual.

```java
OkHttpClient customClient = new OkHttpClient.Builder().addInterceptor(new MyInterceptor()).build();

VehicleServiceCollectionSdk vehicleServiceCollectionSdk = new VehicleServiceCollectionSdk(
  VehicleServiceCollectionSdkConfig.builder().httpClient(customClient).build()
);

```

`MyInterceptor` above is a placeholder for your own `okhttp3.Interceptor`.

> Your client's interceptors are added ahead of the SDK's, so on the outbound request they run before the SDK adds its own headers. A logging interceptor placed this way will **not** see SDK-injected headers such as authentication.

> **Timeout precedence:** when you inject a client, the config-level `timeout` is not applied — your client's own timeout settings are preserved. Per-request, method, and service-level timeout overrides still apply, layered on top of your client.

## Accessing the Raw HTTP Response

Every service method returns the parsed response body by default. When you also need the status code, response headers, or the raw HTTP response, call the same method through the per-call `withRawResponse()` accessor. The default methods are unchanged, so this is fully opt-in.

```java
VehicleServiceCollectionSdkResponse<Object> response =
    vehicleServiceCollectionSdk.vehicleServiceCollectionSdk.withRawResponse().getAllVehicles();

response.getData();
response.getMetadata().getStatusCode();
response.getMetadata().getHeaders();
response.getRaw();
```

`getData()` returns the same value the default method would; `getMetadata()` exposes the status code and headers, and `getRaw()` exposes the underlying HTTP response.

# Sample Usage

Below is a comprehensive example demonstrating how to authenticate and call a simple endpoint:

```java
import com.vehicleservicecollectionsdk.VehicleServiceCollectionSdk;
import com.vehicleservicecollectionsdk.config.ApiKeyAuthConfig;
import com.vehicleservicecollectionsdk.config.VehicleServiceCollectionSdkConfig;
import com.vehicleservicecollectionsdk.exceptions.ApiError;
import com.vehicleservicecollectionsdk.models.GetAllVehiclesParameters;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    VehicleServiceCollectionSdkConfig config = VehicleServiceCollectionSdkConfig.builder()
      .apiKeyAuthConfig(ApiKeyAuthConfig.builder().apiKey("YOUR_API_KEY").build())
      .build();

    VehicleServiceCollectionSdk vehicleServiceCollectionSdk = new VehicleServiceCollectionSdk(
      config
    );

    GetAllVehiclesParameters requestParameters = GetAllVehiclesParameters.builder()
      .brand("Honda")
      .build();

    try {
      Object response = vehicleServiceCollectionSdk.vehicleServiceCollectionSdk.getAllVehicles(
        requestParameters
      );

      System.out.println(response);
    } catch (ApiError e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }

    System.exit(0);
  }
}

```
